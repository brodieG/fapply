# To Do / Questions

## Vetr

* What about the case where you want to reference another argument in a vetting
  expression?  That gets interpreted as a template because the other parameter
  name is not `.`:
  (function(a, b) vetr::vetr(is.logical(.) || is.logical(b)))(1, 2)
  Error in (function(a, b) vetr::vetr(is.logical(.) || is.logical(b)))(a = 1,  :
    For argument `a` at least one of these should pass:
    - `1` should be type "logical" (is "double")
    - `is.logical(1)` is not TRUE (FALSE)
* Do we need to document that the `&&` and `||` tokens are lazy?


## Unitizer

* Annoying that after a re-install, there is no way to rerun the top level
  summary from multiple unitizer runs.  Basically, need a "re-run all requiring
  review" in addition to re-run all updated.
* Dig into git repository sizes and see if `unitizer` has anything to do with
  seemingly large ones.
* Need semi-colons when collapsing calls for display in the browser view, e.g.
  seeing `call9b2 <- quote({x <- x + 1if (b) {x[a] <- yx}x})`.
* Maybe call numbers should be displayed on right, or status on left by number.
* Test file inference should try to match beyond beginning of string.
* When not in tests working directory, see:

    Loading unitizer data...Warning in load_unitizers(store.ids[active], test.files[active], par.frame = util.frame,  :
      Upgraded test file does not match original test file ('subassign-preproc.R' vs 'NA').

## Things to test

* That it is impossible to try to use an allocation before it would be created
  in the code.  Tricky with loops.  Can we check for this within `alloc`?
  Probably, but not trivial, particularly because we change all the previously
  allocated values.  To do this we could record each result allocation, and make
  sure that every function call always has in the leading parameters things in
  that list.  Maybe loops aren't too bad since we just explicitly copy
  back.

* Adjust window iteration size calculation.

* Size computed correctly with concatenations of things produced in branches.

* Eqlen when one of the inputs is group size; maybe working because we paper
  over the NA when `gmax == gmin`

* Extern symbol resolution caching actually works.

* Attempt to use internal symbol in external param is caught.  Maybe test with
  'get' too?  Still can get around by specifying an environment.

## Current

* All the rep checks on times/each/length.out should stay in `rep_size` and
  similar since they are external and shouldn't change.

* Copyright banners in tests have wrong title.
* Doc improvements:
  * Spruce up r2c landing page.
  * Better structuring of topics?
  * Add a performance page?  Generally try to move more arcane stuff out of the
    primary pages to simplify them?

* Think through implication of saving parameter validation functions in r2c_fun
  object in terms of environment capture, etc.

* Check that multi-arg summary cannot have zero args?  Need to automatically
  give it at least one arg to be consistent.

* In alloc.R what's the deal with call.outer vs .CALL?

* Make sure that all loops have interrupts (subset/assign don't).  Also hidden
  in this is `memcpy`.

* Move subassign to assign/control?

## Next

### Optimizations

* Should the numeric at the end of the for loops be a noop and replaced by a
  numeric outside the loop to make it the return value?

* Can we mark some functions as okay to re-use memory, where the result can be
  one of the inputs?

* Profile a compilation call and track (maybe it doesn't matter because really
  it's all about that first compilation to load the tool chain).

* Can we get more memory efficient by e.g. using `+=`.  This is complicated, see
  notes "Memory Re-Use".

* Can we avoid `r2c_copy` in cases where we know the symbol is assigned to from
  an expression?  The big challenge is dealing with e.g. `if` and all the
  constraints that adds.

* Identify unused assignments as a courtesy warning?  This could be extended to
  unused expressions, which could potentially be eliminated (possibly
  iteratively for e.g. `x <- y; z <- x` where then `z` is unused).

### Compilation / Preprocessor / Allocator Performance

We haven't worried too much about optimizing these, but we'll need to keep an
eye on how bad these get.

* Should we convert all function symbols in a call to character to avoid having
  to repeatedly convert them to/from symbols?

### Error Messages

* Error message generation for different size in branches when sizes are
  complex in some way that makes sense to the user that has no idea about the
  univariate polynomial on g business.

* Allow empty formals / no free symbols (e.g. so `1:3` will work).

* Error for size mismatch in `reconcile_cf` need to handle NA size.

* Fix error for invalid literal (not a symbol):

Error in r2cq(x + "a")(5) :
  External argument `a` for `x + "a"` is not unclassed numeric (type: character).

* Need better error messaging that provides overall context for the error (i.e.
  from top level r2c call / runner, as well as local context for the specific
  problematic part of code).  Need to review all `stop` and `Rf_error` in the
  code.
* Particularly for invalid parameter errors, we want to present the call that
  contains the parameter usage in question (i.e. make `call.outer` the next call
  at right depth, maybe we can record parent.id in the preprocessed data).
  Also below the error should be attached to `numeric_along`:

    > fr <- function(x, y) {
    +   res <- numeric_along(x, y)
    +   res + x
    + }
    > f <- r2cf(fr)
    Error in match.call(definition, call, expand.dots, envir) :
      unused argument (y)

* Move the disallowed assignment error to somewhere that does not use the
  renamed expression as that is then incomprehensible.

* Test error handling around missing symbols that are `vcopy`ed.  In particular
  whether error messages around them when they are part of the iteration data vs
  external makes sense.

* `reuse_call` needs to track what the original call was so we can provide
  better error messages if something goes wrong at some point.

* Semi-internal error should issue conditions that can be caught by the
  compilers or runners to return as errors with a meaningful calling function
  instead of an internal function.

### Other

* Subset with logicals.  AFAIK there is no way to pass the type of the input to
  C to make this decision.  We would need to change the interface to add
  support (we could add one more "status" vector to encode the type of each
  parameter, probably needs to be a separate vector since we won't know the
  size).  For subset major issue is result size, which is not knowable
  ex-ante.  Subassign would be okay since size isn't changed.  Do we allow at
  all?  Do we implement which (doesn't resolve the unknowable input size).

* Add the capability to convert a non-numeric external into a numeric external
  with the validation function, e.g. character vector with levels, etc.

* Rationalize `code_gen_*` funs?  We need name, number of params, and the C
  template, but the last one has a bit of variability that might be difficult to
  parametrize generally.  There is a set of functions that do look very similar
  though.

* Should we preprocess `rep` into `rep.int`, `rep_len`, `rep_along`, etc., so
  that we don't have the branches in the C code?  Maybe eventually.

* Should we just used nested environments for name bindings, where each name
  just binds the alloc id?  Problem with this is it's not easy to query the data
  (great for looking up names though).  This might simplify the name management
  logic a bit.

* `:`, `seq`, etc?

* `mean(x) * mean(x)` should re-use `mean(x)` but doesn't?

* Should we drop everything in `alloc$names` matrix and stack) that can be
  recovered from `alloc` via `id0` to mitigate potential synchronization issues?
  The stack is probably the bigger issue, where potentially a named vector would
  work as right now all the fields there are in `alloc`.  `names` actually
  doesn't seem to have any of those.

* Add `get_r_function` to recover an R function with formals, etc.
* `clean_call` should have additional levels to remove `vcopy` / `rec` (Done).
  Decide what `get_r_code` does.

* Empty braces can't just be merged into parent braces, so we need to check the
  empty condition before we simplify them away (`{5;{}}` is not equal to `{5}`).
  Empty braces should be disallowed anyway (iirc they are now).  But could deal
  with these by returning `numeric(0)`.

* Ideas to improve preprocessing:
  * Try to simplify `copy_symdat` by removing unused bindings.  Then being used
    out of context can be simplified to being return value of braces or a being
    used outside of context?  See dead code removal in control notes.
  * Dead code optimization.
  * What are the cost/benefits of doing all operations on renamed names?  One
    big issue to resolve if we want to go this way is that reconciliation will
    have a harder time recognizing what symbols correspond to each other.  One
    benefit is that symbol expiration can be tracked much better.  Presumably
    some other code simplifies too.

* Are we appropriately checking that we don't assign to a symbol that is then
  used as the function name in a call?
* Handle assignment to function symbols, etc?  There shouldn't be confusion with
  invocation, but if we ever implement `lapply`, etc?

* `code_gen_*` functions should be in a list instead of floating around as
  objects.  This would ensure we don't accidentally use the wrong code gen as we
  can select it by name.

* Switch `PASSIVE.SYM` to be `!x %in% ACTIVE.SYM` to reduce the odds of
  accidentally forgetting to designate.  Since we must implement a handling of
  the passive symbols, it is a lot harder to accidentally forget to include
  something in `ACTIVE.SYM`.

* `call_valid` should have an option to check that a call has been matched to
  avoid problems where we introduce a new call via manipulation and it isn't
  matched.  But `call_valid` is used in the matching step too.

* Change default for `show_c_code` to be `all`.

* Cleanup `code_gen_x`.  A lot of things should be parametrized so that we're
  consistent across `code_gen` functions.

* Explore `fma` (floating multiply add).

* Should we be using `islessgreater` and similar?  Probably since the R NaN is
  not quiet by default.

* Be more aggressive about specifying lengths in args.reg (e.g. binops don't
  right now)?

* ISNAN vs isnan? (R_ext/Arith.h).  Return R NAN not just NAN?  For logicals
  doesn't matter as much if they get coerced eventually to NA_LOGICAL, but if we
  add a no-lines mode then it might matter.

* Do we offer a no-lies mode where we don't coerce results back to
  integer/logical?  Yes, should be easy to implement, we just need a parameter
  name that makes sense.
* Add warning for any/all coercion of doubles?

* Can we improve the stand-alone execution so it doesn't suffer the penalty of
  generating the useless group vector?  We should be able to do it through
  `process_groups`, i.e. generating its output, especially if the sorted version
  does not include the order vector.

* Should we have safety tests in the code to be controlled by a debug mode flag?

### Generic

* Improve the ability to provide what group had a bad length `&&` error, and
  possibly the flexibility to warn based on value of
  `_R_CHECK_LENGTH_1_LOGIC2_`.

* Make sure we don't directly capture "r2c_fun" functions from `_pre/data.R` in
  tests as they will capture `_pre/data.R` values.
* Think through the implications of using the lexical env for "r2c_fun"
  functions with respect to the future `r2c` function library (see notes "Eval
  Env") .

* In the allocation data, is it the case that `group` and `is.na(size)` are the
  same?  Maybe, but we need to think ahead to cases where we'll have sizes that
  will be e.g. `n * g + k` where `g` is group size (to allow `c`).
* Will be complicated to think how to convey complex sizes like the ones
  generated by `c` would be.

* Look into the standalone R math library.

* Consider whether `x^2` -> `x * x` should be an optimization (especially given
  that `x` could be a complex expression (actual, this special case is handled
  with `square` which avoids the repetition).
* Now that we have `reuse_calls`, do we want to use `x * x` instead of `square`?
* Transformations probably should not be considered optimizations, because e.g.
  for `square` not applying it leads to non-identical results.

* Make sure vecrec works with `...`, e.g. as would be needed for `paste(...)`
  (although maybe that's not the best example given 0-len behavior).  Test would
  be to implement `pmax`.

* Add post-processing of function result (e.g. to attach names, etc, as in
  `quantile`).

* Rename depth to height.  No, rename depth to level.  The use of height and
  depth with an upside down tree is ridiculous and not my fault.

## For CRAN

* Include README/extra contents in vignettes

* Figure out why winbuilder doesn't work.

* Errors in `match.call` that show the deparsed argument might deparse
  differently on different systems (`group_sum` error tests).

* Add iterator breaks?

* Make sure calling mechanism is legal

## Other

* share `lcurry` with klutometis
  https://github.com/klutometis/R-functional/issues
* Make overflow testable.
* Group label generation should potentially return position of vector rather
  than actual label to allow flexible re-use of labels beyond just factors (i.e.
  we subset the input vector to generate the labels).
* Special case of constant result lengths could be an optimization for group
  where we don't have to generate the vector, although there should always be
  few groups relative to vector elements, so complexity not worth it?
* Migrate to tapply structure.  More generally, explain interface?
* Allow more then `INT_MAX` groups (labels are limiting right now)?
* What if compilation fails, do we have good error messages?
* Don't use double for group sizes unless we have groups that are too large.
  **probably not worth it** b/c the group sizes result is only as big as the
  number of groups, so very small in the grand scheme of things.  First level is
  simply to check input vector size, and if less than `INT_MAX` use that, next
  step would be to switch from int to double if we do have a vector that exceeds
  the size limit (but then we need to test for that...).  Does that mean we need
  a limit to int?  Will be annoying to have logic for both.
* Should sorted be "assume.sorted"?  Probably.  Could add check that it is (see
  next).
* Process groups might be able to determine that things are sorted?  If things
  are always e.g. increasing, then it must be the case that they are sorted.
  Evaluate the overhead of this; should be low as it would just be done in the
  second pass that stores the sizes?  Something still needs to be declared as
  sorted though.  It's relatively cheap to check that it is, but not so cheap
  that we would always want to run that check.
* Perhaps we got too lazy with POW, do we need to handle all the other cases
  arith handles?  Maybe, but if we do we'll likely need our own `pow` function,
  as it stands right now we're likely to get non-identical results in the case
  of NA or Inf (or at least particular variations of them).
* Re-implement modulo.
* The `check=TRUE` might be better done with an explicit check function.
* For running function directly, can we pass data as an env so the traceback
  doesn't explode (but make sure this doesn't cause reference / refcount issues)?
* What is the implementation cost of allowing internal functions to advance the
  data pointers so they don't have to be manually moved after each function
  iteration?
* Implement sum64 and mean64 to use double accumulator (note we've tested that
  double accumulators are slower).
* We can no longer use `mean <- mean.default` and `r2c` at same time (this might
  be correct, but will make readme a bit more complicated).  Also, error message
  is very confusing in this case as `mean.default` is also from the base
  namespace, even though the masking is defined at the global level.
* Add destructors that will unload the shlib and delete file file when the
  corresponding object is garbage collected (finalizer).
* Add check to `r2c` funs that verify the `r2c` version, the R version, and the
  platform (anything else)?
* Figure out a better way to store the object than embedding it with `bquote` in
  the function (e.g. retrieve from the call like `rlang`, but not sure that's
  better).
* Think about `df %>% group_by(g) %>% filter(x > min(df$x)`.  This should
  resolve naturally if we allow `[['x']]` as "normal" expression.
* Can we optimize label generation for cases where the last step is constant
  size or size of groups?
* Better introspection tools for intermediate products so we can see what they
  are.
* Are names sufficient to disqualify from nakedness?  How do names behave in
  recycling?  Do we want to allow other attributes to persist?
* Make sure to have a function that uses the `ctrl` functionality to check that
  it works properly (once we switch to `flag` for most functions).
* Make sure pointer arrays are aligned.  Use `malloc`?  If so internal code
  cannot use `error`, and we can't guarantee that?  Can we register a finalizer
  somehow (probably will need to).
* Make sure headers go in in correct order; it may not work if we structure
  workflow around C functions?  Maybe okay if each group of functions does the
  right thing?  Do we need to include the headers before each group of
  functions?  Do we need to keep translation units independent (but the lose the
  benefit of static funs)?  This is almost certainly a real problem that needs
  to be addressed.
* Ensure all entry point names are unique and that there are no collisions.
  Maybe this can be done on registration?
* Special case where all groups are same size and there is an external vector of
  that size?
* Add capability to specify functions in non-standard ways (e.g. `base::sum`, or
  `(get("sum", as.environment("package:base"))`)?  Maybe not, that seems like
  potential trouble.  Certainly document also things like `f <- sum; f(x)`.
* Is it faster to compute complex expressions pairwise (i.e. full vector scan of
  two vectors), or do each row in full once?
* Look into using R_GetCCallable (see WRE) instead of what we're doing now.  It
  seems though that to do so we'll need to generate a full package which will
  further slow down the compilation.  What does `inline` do?
* Check name isn't used already.
* `?SHLIB` states some binary distributions don't include `R CMD SHLIB`.
* Figure out how to call the current version of R (e.g. `RD CMD SHLIB`).
* See how far back this works in terms of R versions.
* What happens when this stuff is serialized?
* Is there an alternative to R_FindSymbol?  Can we get it to be made part of the
  API.
* Can we use this in some way for e.g. really wide matrices where each column
  takes the place of an argument?  Generating a pointer for each column then may
  be less efficient.
* Lags and similar (i.e. `x[i] = x[i] * x[i - 1]`).
* Re-use repeated expressions.
