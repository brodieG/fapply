## External vs. Control

For functions that rely on an external input (we don't have any at the moment),
can we just rely wholly on the control parameter?

We just include a control validation function, and then subsequent to that in
each iteration we directly access the value?

A few issues:

* We really don't want to have to use `REAL(x)[0]` each iteration; for control
  parameters that are supposed to evaluate to doubles it would be nice if we
  could just throw them in the data array.
* Maybe that is the purpose of "extern", has the same semantics as "control",
  but is required to evaluate to a numeric so we can throw it in the data pile.
  So e.g. `quantile` could rely on "extern" instead of control.

Is "extern" the right name?  Seems like that is the overall category for
"control", "flag", and "numeric".  More broadly, maybe "control" is also not
right".  Really we're dealing with "ext.generic", "ext.lgl", and "ext.num".

More generally, maybe we can simplify the control parameter thing to be
external/internal.  The distinction between flag/general/numeric can be an
implementation detail (I guess it kind of is already).

## Eval of External Args

Maybe we can set up an environment where we keep adding any internal symbols as
active bindings that blow up if you try to use them?

    env <- new.env()
    makeActiveBinding("a", function() stop('boom'), env)
    evalq(sum(a), env)

Probably want to signal a condition that we catch, where we embed the symbol
name in the message of the condition, and then we can compose a meaningful
message like:

> Attempt to use internal symbol via an external parameter.
