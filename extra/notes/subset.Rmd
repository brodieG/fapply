# Subset

## Types of Indices

Do we only allow strictly positive?  Maybe we can get away with zeroes b/c the
result is smaller, but the mismatch between the pre-computed size and the
runtime size is a little concerning.

Negative indices seem out of the question since we cannot know what the size of
the result will be before run time.  We can know it will be no larger than the
larger of the index or the data vector.  Since we set the size of the result,
maybe this is okay so long as the actual result is smaller than the pre-computed
one?  One way this goes wrong is for the final return vector
