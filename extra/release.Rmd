New {r2c} release is available. {r2c} is an experimental package that compiles a
small but useful subset of R for fast iterated statistics.  This new release
adds window functions.

1/n

For arbitrary statistics {r2c} is much faster.  For pre-defined statistics,
{r2c} is as fast as dedicated compiled functions that compute each window in
full (see README).

2/n

`{r2c}` includes many window application methods, some I have not seen
elsewhere.  E.g you can compute rolling prior twelve month sales as of the 1st
of each month, with sales at arbitrary times.

* Integer spaced
  * Integer spaced regular.
  * Integer spaced regular variable width.
* Arbitrary spaced
  * Fixed sized windows

3/n

{r2c} also implements fast iterated group statistics. See the previous
announcement for details.

```
set.seed(1)
count <- 28
frequency <- 1/(3600 * 24 * 15)
time <- as.POSIXct('2022-01-01') - rev(cumsum(rexp(count, frequency)))
revenue <- runif(count) * 100
months <- seq(as.POSIXct('2020-10-01'), to=max(time), by="+1 month")
left <- head(months, -3)
right <- tail(months, -3)
bwmo <- rollbw_exec(r2c_mean, revenue, position=time, left=left, right=right)
rev.qtr <- data.frame(left, right, prev.qtr=bwmo)

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data.frame(time, revenue)) +
  geom_point(aes(time, revenue)) +
  geom_rect(
    data=rev.qtr, aes(xmin=left, xmax=right, ymin=0, ymax=prev.qtr, fill=left),
    alpha=.3
  ) +
  geom_point(
    data=rev.qtr, aes(x=right, y=prev.qtr, color=left), size=4
  ) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  scale_color_viridis_c()
```
